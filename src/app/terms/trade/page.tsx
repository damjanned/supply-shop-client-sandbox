            Any time specified by the Seller for Delivery of the Goods is an
            estimate only and the Seller will not be liable for any loss or
            damage incurred by the Client because of Delivery being late.
            However, both parties agree that they shall make every endeavour to
            enable the Goods to be delivered at the time and place as was
            arranged between both parties. If the Seller is unable to supply the
            Goods as agreed solely due to any action or inaction of the Client,
            then the Seller shall be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for
            redelivery and/or storage.
